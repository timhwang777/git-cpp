## About the Project
This project is about building simple Git tools in `C++`. I have built some plumbing tools like `cat-file`, `ls-tree`, and `clone`. Please note that this project is primarily a practice project to help me understand the concepts of `git` and `C++` libraries like `curl` and `filesystem`, among others. Please do not include this code in your project. 

## Getting Started
To run the project, please execute the shell script:
```shell
./your_git.sh
```

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have install all the dependencies and libraries for the project. Inspect the `/src` folder and source codes for more information.
